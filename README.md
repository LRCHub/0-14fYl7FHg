```
Ayy, uh
Bitch,
I'm 21 but I still walk
around with fake ID
(What?)
Cuddle with the homies
watching
"Stand by Me"
(Cute)
This dick ain't free,
baby, pay my fee
(Bread)
Let me live my life, baby,
c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Tall bitch, I Attack on Titan
Need a fine VP like Biden
Trap that purp into gold
like a viking
(Uh)
Double cup ice
like Tampa Lightning
Double cup, ain't no lean
Only sip syrup
when I'm with Chief Keef
Play clean, pipe Christine
I pipe correct, I'm so P.C.
Go to the club
and I don't even drink
I don't know what to think
Got a girl with me
And we pop in the kitchen
Dick on hard,
my nuts on a mission
I got cash,
I got coins on my mileage E-D-D,
your credit looking childish
Your girlfriend just changed
her name to my bitch
She got LASIK,
got nut on her iris
(Nut on her iris?)
Board in the mom, yeah,
just like a virus
Tongue game nutty,
I ain't talking no Cyrus
Pulled up on the booty,
yeah, we some pirates
I don't know why,
we got huge privates
(Woah)
I guess we're kinda blessed,
I can't complain about it
(Uh)
Every day I get another check,
I won't complain about it
Bitch, I'm 21 but I still
walk around with fake ID
(What?)
Cuddle with the homies
watching "Stand by Me"
(Cute)
This dick ain't free,
baby, pay my fee
(Bread)
Let me live my life,
baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Bubble bath in a bucket of cash
When your bitch said
"Gravy, put it in my ass"
Let's run it
(Uh)
'cause you kindly asked
I guess I'll be a gentleman
and bust and smash
But then you gotta help me
smoke this gas
And count some cash
and trap some hash
And then I need a ride
to my cooking class
Gravy train "Choo-choo"
on that ass
Skrrt in a mediocre,
whip down Fairfax
Bitch, I'm a king,
you a peasant in the barracks
(Bitch)
Chillin' with a pornstar,
life like an IMAX
Fuck grammar one time,
no syntax
Cock real hard, yeah,
I'm horny for the big racks
Crack my nuts,
she can juice my gonads
Baby yes popstar,
Selena Gomez
Always make big moves,
last name nomad
Troll so much,
made a song called "u mad!"
Next bar Gravy says I wrote,
he mad
Ooh, ayy
Baby, c'est la vie
Finger-lickin' good like
it's KFC
I learned to count
a mil' before my ABCs
Fuck your Delta-8,
your bitch ate my D
Bitch, I'm 21 but I still
walk around with fake ID
(What?)
Cuddle with the homies
watching "Stand by Me"
(Cute)
This dick ain't free,
baby, pay my fee
(Bread)
Let me live my life,
baby, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
Woo-woo, c'est la vie
